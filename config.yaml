  system_template_judge: >
     You are an expert Italian linguist and translation evaluator. Your task is to assess a translation of a sentence from old italian into modern Italian. You must assign a score from 1 to 5 for each of the following evaluation criteria. Provide only the requested scores, without explanations or additional commentary.

  user_template_judge: >
   Evaluate the translation using these five criteria:
   
   Meaning Preservation
    1: Completely diverges in meaning, major misinterpretations or hallucinations
    2: Core ideas are misrepresented or lost, with significant meaning shift
    3: Mostly correct meaning, but with noticeable errors (minor shifts or omissions)
    4: Meaning is preserved with minor discrepancies or nuances lost
    5: Fully faithful to the original meaning

   Grammar
    1: Barely readable or nonsensical
    2: Grammatically flawed throughout, affecting understanding
    3: Minor grammatical or syntactic errors, but understandable
    4: Fluent, with native-like grammar and syntax, but minor oddities
    5: Perfectly fluent and natural in the target Language

    Modern Structural Effectiveness
    1: Structure is archaic or rigid, hard to follow; mimics original in a way that hinders readability.
    2: Structure is awkward or overly literal; noticeably unnatural for modern Italian.
    3: Mixed structure; understandable but includes dated or clumsy phrasing.
    4: Mostly fluent and modern structure; minor awkwardness or stiffness remains.
    5: Fully natural and idiomatic structure; clear, fluent, and appropriate for contemporary Italian.

    Completeness
    1: Large parts missing or major hallucinated content
    2: Multiple omissions or additions altering meaning
    3: Minor omissions or additions that donâ€™t significantly alter meaning
    4: Nearly complete with only slight trimming
    5: Fully complete with no omissions or additions

    Lexical Modernization
    1: No modernization; reads like the original.
    2: Mostly archaic or unnatural word choices.
    3: Mixture of modern and archaic.
    4: Slightly dated or formal, but still acceptable in modern Italian.
    5: Modern terms feel natural, idiomatic, and true to current Italian usage.

    ###Task Description:
    An instruction, two responses (A and B), and a score rubric are given.

    1. Compare Response A and Response B based on the given rubric.
    2. Determine which one is better and explain **why**, using objective criteria from the rubric.
    3. After the explanation, return your judgment in the following format:

    "[Result]: Response (A/B) is better."

    4. Do not generate any other opening, closing, or unrelated text.

    ###The instruction to evaluate:
    You need to choose the better translation from old Italian sentence into modern Italian between two translations.

    ###Response A:
    {response_a}

    ###Response B:
    {response_b}

    ###Reference Answer (Gold):
    {reference_answer}

    ###Score Rubric:
    Is the translation faithful to the original meaning, grammatically correct, structurally modern, complete, and lexically modernized?

    ###Feedback:
  absolute:

      ###Task Description:
      An instruction, a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
      1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
      2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the score rubric.
      3. The output format should look as follows: "Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (an integer number between 1 and 5)"
      4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

      ###The instruction to evaluate:
      You need to evaluate the translation of an old Italian sentence into modern Italian based on the reference answer that gets a score of 5.

      ###Response to evaluate:
      {response}

      ###Reference Answer (Score 5):
      {reference_answer}

      ###Score Rubrics:
