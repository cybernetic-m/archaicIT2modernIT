Instead of one aggregated score, you can break the evaluation into sub-rubrics, each focusing on a specific dimension.

Meaning Preservation
1: Completely diverges in meaning, major misinterpretations or hallucinations
2: Core ideas are misrepresented or lost, with significant meaning shift
3: Mostly correct meaning, but with noticeable errors (minor shifts or omissions)
4: Meaning is preserved with minor discrepancies or nuances lost
5: Fully faithful to the original meaning


Grammar
1: Barely readable or nonsensical
2: Grammatically flawed throughout, affecting understanding
3: Minor grammatical or syntactic errors, but understandable
4: Fluent, with native-like grammar and syntax, but minor oddities
5: Perfectly fluent and natural in the target Language

Style Matching
1: Tone and style completely off (e.g. formal for slang)
2: Style mismatch that makes the translation jarring
3: Mostly consistent style, some mismatches
4: Style fits, though with slight inconsistencies in tone
5: Style and register match the source perfectly


Structural Alignment
1: Sentence structure completely changes or collapses
2: Structural elements are lost or reordered drastically
3: Mostly follows structure, with some reordering or changes
4: Retains source structure with minimal deviations
5: Mirrors sentence and paragraph structure effectively




Completeness
1: Large parts missing or major hallucinated content
2: Multiple omissions or additions altering meaning
3: Minor omissions or additions that don’t significantly alter meaning
4: Nearly complete with only slight trimming
5: Fully complete with no omissions or additions




Holistic Judgment
When making a holistic judgment, ask:
- Does it feel natural and human-like? 
- Is the core meaning and tone preserved?
- Would a fluent speaker accept this without blinking?
- Is the translation suitable for its intended audience/context?

Evaluation for holistic judgment:
1	Useless translation, unreadable or irrelevant
2	Seriously flawed, distorts meaning too much
3	Understandable but clearly imperfect
4	Very good, with only minor non-disruptive flaws
5	Excellent; clear, fluent, and faithful—needs no changes







Few-Shot Prompting with Gold Examples
Give the LLM examples of good vs bad translations with explanations, then ask it to evaluate a new one. This sets a normative baseline so the LLM "knows" what counts as a good translation.
